# Furry-Octo-Journey 🐕
This repository will show all of the steps required to bring all of my applications up in the event of losing my VPS. 

# Foreword ⏱️
This repository is still heavily under development and there really isn't much documentation on how things work. I'm still planning on trying to provide documentation for others who might be trying to do something similar to me. I know that the journey to getting all of these things to work cohesively is very difficult but very worth doing. I'm hoping that the documentation and bread crumbs I leave behind will help you advance your understanding 😅
